# US_Retail_Grocery_Analysis
## Introduction:-
This project is regarding the Retail Grocery Industry  data Analysis. It includes ETL process using SPARK SQL to process the data present in Grocery's Data Lake so as to gain insights from the data and use that for  strategic business decision making to gain an edge over the competitors.

As part of this capstone project, we will build an ETL Pipeline as part of data engineering solution. We will clean the data, do some preprocessing on it as per the business requirement and finally we will load the data to destination (which is a datalake). In the end we will also do some analysis on the data wich we have cleaned and saved in the datalake to see how it can be helpful for the business.
