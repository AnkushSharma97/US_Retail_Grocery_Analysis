# US_Retail_Grocery_Analysis
## Introduction:-
This project is regarding the Retail Grocery Industry  data Analysis. It includes data processing using SPARK SQL to process the data present in Grocery's Data Lake. After processing the data we will use it for gaining insights and strategic business decision making so as to gain an edge over the competitors.

## Problem Statement:-
The retail grocery industry in the United States faces a precarious economic environment. Due primarily to competition from warehouse clubs, supercentres, and e-commerce, retail grocery sales have underperformed the U.S. retail sector and the overall U.S. economy, and employment growth in the industry has been stagnant.

The specific business problem is to drive higher sales volume and customer retention. The solution involved building

## Objective:-
As part of this capstone project, we will build an ETL Pipeline as part of data engineering solution. We will clean the data, do some preprocessing on it as per the business requirement and finally we will load the data to destination (which is a datalake). In the end we will also do some analysis on the data which we have cleaned and saved in the datalake to see how it can be helpful for the business.
